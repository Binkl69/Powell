<!-- This a comment, Powell is just repeating stuff we know about-->

<p style="border:solid; background-color: aqua; font-family:Helvetica; font-size: larger;">I'm new to software design and I'm creating and learing new things everyday. <br><a href="https://github.com/Binkl69">This is my github</a> <strong> and if you feel like it, have a look at my work</strong>,
it means a lot to me and makes me feel like someone else cares about my journey. <br><em>My wish is to create things that I love and hopefully the world are going to love them too</em></p>
